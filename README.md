# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Garrett
A former jazz musician turned full-stack programmer hungry to deploy my creative skills within a new field.

In many ways, I think the aspects of my personality that made me excel musically are the same that drove me towards the world of programming. A huge part of studying music is the process of exploring new systems, learning the various rules, and seeing how they relate to what you already know. I've found programming to be remarkably similar, with the many frameworks and languages akin to different scales, chords, songs, or ensembles.

I strongly believe that my creative, curious demeanor, and ability to flexibly integrate into a team is of value to any future employer.

## Projects
**Noodlr 2.0** | <a href="https://noodlr.netlify.app" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> | [Repo](https://github.com/Garrett-Bodley/noodlr-2.0)

TLDR: Noodlr with a facelift.

While I was happy with the logic of the original Noodlr, the site had an underwhelming UI to say the least. After spending some time learning more about CSS and front end technologies in general, I decided to rebuild it from scratch.

Noodlr 2.0 is built with 100% functional components. It utilizes custom hooks, custom Context Providers, react-spring and more. Currently a front-end only web-app, though a fleshed out back end is in the works.

An online step sequencer allowing users to experiment with creating their own music.

Built with a Rails API backend and a React Redux Frontend. Utilizes [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) to programmatically generate music.

**Breadbook** | <a href="https://breadbook.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> | [Repo](https://github.com/Garrett-Bodley/BreadBook)

An expansion on Sourdough Tracker, BreadBook incorporates social media functionality, allowing users to browse the recipes and ingredients of other users (ranked by usage or popularity if desired). Users may comment on, like, and bookmark various recipes as well.

Built with Ruby on Rails.

**Sourdough Tracker** | <a href="https://sourdough-trackr.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a> | [Repo](https://github.com/Garrett-Bodley/sourdough-tracker)

While making sourdough, like any process utilizing fermentation, there exists natural variation due to temperature, humidity, starter strength, etc. Sourdough Tracker is an online utility that helps users log actions throughout the process, tracking the time, what was done, and leaving space for any additional notes.

Built with Sinatra
