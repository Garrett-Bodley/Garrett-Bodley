# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Garrett
A former jazz musician turned full-stack programmer hungry to deploy my creative skills within a new field.

In many ways, I think the aspects of my personality that made me excel musically are the same the drove me towards the world of programming. A huge part of studying music is the process of exploring new systems, learning the various rules, and seeing how they relate to what you already know. I've found programming to be remarkably similar, with the many frameworks and languages akin to a different scale, chord, song, or ensemble

I strongly believe that my creative, curious demeanor, and ability to flexibly integrate into a team is of value to any future employer.
